Mini-project Title - Online Voting System 
based on Socket Programming 

Objective - To create an application for safe online voting and eliminate the need of offline voting 

Key features - 
    ✅Validation of voter id
    ✅Displaying list of candidates based on constituency (From a Database via Socket Programming) Using TCP 
    ✅Recording user when they are voting and send it to a secure server (via Socket Programming) Using UDP
    ✅Only the user must be present in front of the screen at the time of voting ( Verified by ML and Image Processing )
    ✅Multi -Threaded server - for handling multiple client requests at a time 
    ✅Later Ensuring only one vote per user 
    ✅Sending encrypted polling details to a server (via Socket Programming) Using TCP
    ✅SSL

Unique features - 
    ✅Recording users and 
    ✅Checking if multiple users are present at the time of voting 

In conclusion, the Online Voting System employs Socket Programming to secure, streamline, and ensure precise voting, 
integrating user authentication, candidate listing, encrypted data transmission, 
and multi-threaded server functionalities for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.
